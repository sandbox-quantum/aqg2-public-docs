However, using a passphrase as a cryptographic key is risky because passwords usually are not sufficiently random.  In practice, this means passwords are vulnerable to dictionary attacks, where attackers systematically try passwords based on their frequency of use. Additionally, cryptographic primitives typically guarantee security only when used with random keys, meaning using passwords as cryptographic keys can compromise the entire cryptographic protocol. </p> <p>To mitigate these risks, a password needs to be passed through a dedicated PBKDF before being fed into any other cryptographic algorithm.  In addition, PBKDFs need to be used to store passwords. Instead of storing passwords in plain text, the PBKDF output should be stored and compared during authentication.</p> <p>PBKDFs are essentially slow, salted hash functions.  That means, a salt\u2014a random string\u2014is added to the password input of the hash function to slow down brute-force search attacks enough to make them uneconomical.  More concretely, it forces an attacker to target each password with a dedicated brute-force attack instead of simply pre-computing common (password, PBKDF output) pairs and checking against this table.  The salt provides domain separation between users and does not need to be kept secret. Given that PBKDFs take in user passwords, it is often not critical that they run as fast as possible.  Put differently, if a PBKDF runs for 100 milliseconds, this slowdown is barely notable to a user, but slows down a brute force attack considerably.  Of course, this comparison is premised on the assumption that the PBKDF implementation relied upon by a server and by an adversary run in a comparable amount of time.</p> <p>A common design principle used for PBKDF is to repeatedly apply a so-called \u201cpseudorandom function\u201d (PRF) for many iterations using the password as the key.

This makes collisions (i.e. occasions that two stored passwords use the same salt) unlikely.  By the birthday bound, we would expect a collision after a bit more than 4 billion passwords.

It works by generating a pair of keys: a public key for encryption or signature verification and a private key for decryption or signature generation, ensuring that only the intended recipient or signer can perform the corresponding cryptographic operation. During key generation, two large primes are chosen independently and with enough randomness. Their product is taken as the RSA modulus.  The cryptographic primitives are designed such that the participating entities perform modular exponentiation, raising a number to an exponent modulo the chosen exponent.  This modular exponentiation can be computed efficiently. An eavesdropper attempting to decrypt an encryption or forge a signature is faced with a hard computational problem, which is inverse to modular exponentiation. Next, we provide an example focussing on encryption to provide intuition to the reader. It is followed by a description of the signature modes.  </p> <p>Key Generation example: RSA key generation starts with two distinct odd prime numbers, p and q, generated at random.  The RSA modulus is their product, n=pq. The RSA encryption exponent e\\&lt;(p-1)(q-1) with certain mathematical properties is then chosen.  A popular choice in practice is  65537=2<sup>16</sup>+1, for efficiency.  The decryption exponent d is then computed as an integer such that ed equals 1 modulo the least common multiple of p-1 and q-1.  The secret private key is (p,q,d) and the public key is (n,e).</p> <p>Encryption scheme example: Consider Bob wanting to encrypt and send a message m to Alice.  Alice generates a key pair as above, sends Bob the public key (n,e) and keeps the private key (p,q,d) secret.  Bob encodes the message into a positive integer encode(m)&lt;n and sends Alice the encrypted message c= encode(m)<sup>e</sup> modulo n.  Here, encode(m) is a possibly randomized cryptographically secure encoding function.  The arithmetic of RSA is such that Alice can recover encode(m) as c<sup>d</sup> modulo n.</p> <p>In the original RSA proposal, the encoding function is deterministic.  The resulting encryption and decryption primitives are referred to as RSAEP and RSADP, respectively, by IETF PKCS1.  It is a deterministic encryption scheme, meaning that, given a chosen public key, the encryption is a deterministic function of the message.  Therefore, it is not semantically secure and vulnerable to chosen-plaintext attacks. Furthermore, it is malleable and insecure under chosen cipher-text attacks.</p> <p>To mitigate these issues, the message has to be randomly \u201cpadded\u201d appropriately while being encoded as an integer. Two encryption modes resulting from the choice of padding are RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 and RSAES-OAEP.  The RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 padding scheme predates RSAES-OAEP and is deprecated by IETF due to vulnerability to the Bleichenbacher attack.</p> <p>RSAES-OAEP. The Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP) is a padding scheme to mitigate aforementioned security issues arising from plain RSA being a deterministic encryption scheme (see, for instance NIST SP 800-56B Rev. 2, section 7.2.2).  It consists of encryption/decryption primitives RSAEP/RSADP, a cryptographic hash function H, a possibly different cryptographic hash function to serve as a mask generating function (MGF) and a random number bit generator (RBF).  RSAES-OAEP is IND-CCA2 secure, meaning it ensures security even against chosen-ciphertext attacks such as the Bleichenbacher attack.</p> <p>RSA Signature: There are two signature modes, namely  RSASSA-PSS and RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 (see for instance, IETS #1: RSA Cryptography Specifications Version 2.2.)  Unlike the encryption case, no attacks are known against the signature scheme RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using the PKCS1-v1_5 padding.  Yet, as a precautionary measure, IETF requires RSASSA-PSS in new applications. RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 schemes may still persist, for compatibility with existing applications.  </p> <p>RSA Key Agreement: NIST SP 800-56B Rev. 2 describes two families (KAS1 and KAS2) of RSA based key agreement schemes and a family KTS-OAEP of key transfer mechanisms.  Both the agreement schemes employ RSA secret value encapsulation RSASVE as a primitive.  The main distinction between KAS1 and KAS2 is that in the former, only one of the party\u2019s key-establishment keys is used.  In the latter, both the party\u2019s key-establishment keys are used. As a consequence, KAS1 only comes with two confirmation modes KAS1-basic (with no confirmation) and KAS1-party_V-confirmation.  Whereas KAS2 accommodates KAS2-basic, KAS2-party_V-confirmation, KAS2-party_U-confirmation and KAS2- bilateral-confirmation.  See NIST SP 800-56B Rev. 2 section 10 for contexts in which KAS1, KAS2 or KTS-OAEP are recommended.</p>"},{"location":"kb-articles/rsa-algorithm/#security-recommendations","title":"Security recommendations","text":"<p>The best known classical cryptanalytic algorithm to break RSA is the Number Field Sieve integer factorization algorithm.

While these attacks primarily focus on extracting secret keys, they can also target other sensitive information, such as plaintext messages. These vulnerabilities stem from implementation flaws, hardware design issues, or environmental factors, rather than weaknesses in the cryptographic algorithms themselves.</p> <p>To better understand the nature of timing and side-channel attacks, and the techniques used to mitigate them, we will introduce a few key definitions.</p> Timing side-channel attacks A timing side-channel is a vulnerability where an attacker can infer secret information by observing variations in how long a cryptographic operation takes to execute. For instance, if a program\u2019s execution time changes depending on a secret value\u2014as in the example <code>if(secret == x) then do_something()</code>\u2014an attacker can analyze these timing differences (in a conditional branch) to infer the secret value. Power or EM side-channel attacks A power or electromagnetic (EM) side-channel is a vulnerability where an attacker can infer secret data by observing physical emissions such as electromagnetic radiation or measuring power consumption. As a simple illustration, during the operation <code>c = a*b</code>, power consumption or EM emissions may differ depending on whether <code>b = 42</code> or <code>b = 0</code>, as setting a register to a non-zero value consumes slightly more power than leaving it at zero. These variations may correlate with the secret data, enabling attackers to extract sensitive information. Countermeasures to timing attacks Timing side-channels are mitigated with \u201cconstant-time programming\u201d techniques. This approach involves implementing cryptographic algorithms in a way that ensures their execution time is independent of the specific values of secret data. It involves eliminating execution time variations caused by: <ul><li>Conditional branches based on secret data</li><li>Memory accesses with indices derived from secret values</li><li>Instructions with data-dependent timing to process secret values, such as division, where execution time varies depending on the input values.</li></ul>The key is to ensure that all code paths execute in constant-time, independent of the values of secret data, ensuring that no timing differences leak information. While the term \u201cconstant-time\u201d suggests uniform execution time, in this context it means ensuring that the execution time depends only on non-secret factors, such as the algorithm itself, the length of the input, and public parameters. Countermeasures to power or EM side-channels Mitigating power or EM side-channels involves extending the principles of constant-time programming to ensure that physical emissions, such as power consumption or electromagnetic radiation, are independent of the specific values of secret data. For instance, during the operation <code>c = a*b</code>, the power usage or EM emissions should remain identical regardless of whether <code>b = 42</code> or <code>b = 0</code>. This is achieved through various techniques including masking, balancing operations, noise injection, and using specialized hardware protections such as electromagnetic shielding."},{"location":"kb-articles/timing-attacks-and-broader-side-channel-attacks/#implementations-with-known-side-channel-risks","title":"Implementations with known side-channel risks","text":"<p>Cryptographic implementations are inherently susceptible to side-channel attacks due to unintended information leakage during execution on commodity hardware.
